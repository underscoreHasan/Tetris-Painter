# Hasan Noor's Personal Project
## Tetris

- What will the application do?

    - The application will provide a graphical environment to play a game that can be controlled by the users keyboard.
  The game will be rendered simply and will follow the rules of Tetris. To save a state of a game, the user would just
  have to pause and exit the game. Between all save states a high score will also be tracked.


- Who will use it?

    - The application could be used by **anyone** who wants to play the game and has a computer that is able to render it.


- Why is this project of interest to you?
    - This project is of interest to me since I have never coded a GUI-based application that requires large amounts of
  user interaction before.

## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to control the movement of Tetris blocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to control the orientation of Tetris blocks.
- As a user, I want random Tetris blocks to be generated.
- As a user, I want to be able to view what my current score is.
- As a user, I want to be able to control the game using my keyboard.
- As a user, I want to be able to place a block on a collection of placed blocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my to-do list from file (if I so choose)

## Attributions:
- The UI in this project draws inspiration from the implementation of the UI in TellerApp.
