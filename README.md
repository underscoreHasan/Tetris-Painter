# Hasan Noor's Personal Project
## Tetris Painter

- What will the application do?

    - The application will provide a graphical environment to paint in that can be controlled by the users keyboard.
  The app will be rendered simply and will follow the rules of a Tetris board. To save a state of a painting, the user
  would have to click a save button the game. A score will also be tracked.


- Who will use it?

    - The application could be used by **anyone** who wants to use the painter and has a computer that is able to render it.


- Why is this project of interest to you?
    - This project is of interest to me since I have never coded a GUI-based application that requires large amounts of
  user interaction before.
