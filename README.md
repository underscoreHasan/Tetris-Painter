# Tetris Painter

- This app provides a Tetris-style GUI for the user to freely move around and place randomly generated Tetris blocks in order to draw an image of their liking. Additionally, the paintings are saveable and loadable from memory as JSON.

### Example:
##### Two Among Us crewmates looking at each other, the desert sun shining in the background
###### - Vincent Van Gogh, 1889

- This project was of interest to me since I had never coded a GUI-based application that requires large amounts of user interaction before, and it served as an excellent launchpad into GUI development, Software Development Life Cycles, and Test Driven Development. Importantly, the project also greatly increased my profiency in Java, OOP, and data structures and algorithms.

### The following are the User Stories that were successfully implemented during the term project:

- As a user, I want to be able to control the movement of Tetris blocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to control the orientation of Tetris blocks.
- As a user, I want random Tetris blocks to be generated.
- As a user, I want to be able to view what my current score is.
- As a user, I want to be able to control the painter using my keyboard.
- As a user, I want to be able to place a block on a collection of placed blocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of my painting to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load the saved state of my painting from file (if I so choose)
